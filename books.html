			<img src="btn.jpg" height="300px" width="199px">
			<div class="text"> 7. Between the Notes by Sharon Huss Roat <br><p class="bio"> This is one of the best and heart-fluttering books YA Novels that I have ever read. It‚Äôs just pure romance and cute scenes, but with a little of being true to one‚Äôs self. I really suggest this book because Ivy Emerson and Lennie Lazarski‚Äôs relationship (with a lot of plot twists) is absolutely worth the read. </p></div>

			<div class="text"> 5. Every Last Word by Tamara Ireland Stone <br><p class="bio"> I don‚Äôt think I will ever have the enough words to describe how amazing this novel is. It teaches us that OCD is something serious and is a very challenging problem that lots have to deal with everyday. It also reflects how therapists are really a big help to those with disorders and how much they influence and bring positivity to their patients. This book circles on poetry, friendships, relationships and if you do choose to read it, be prepared for an emotional roller coaster ride. </p> </div>
