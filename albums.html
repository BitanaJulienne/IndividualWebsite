This debut studio album of his was released on October 4, 2010 and was able to grabe the nomination for Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Fun fact, the name "Hooligans" is given to Bruno's fans. </p>

		2. Divide by Ed Sheeran
			<br> <img src="ed.jpg">
			<br> <p class="bio"> Honestly, I am not a fan of Ed Sheeran. But when he released an album after 3 years, I completely fell for the songs in it. They all have sweet and heartbreaking messages behind them, you can cry while listening to it the first time. My favorites from the album are "Happier" and "Perfect." </p>
		1. Beauty and the Beast (2017) Soundtrack
			<br> <img src="batb.jpg">
			<br> <p class="bio"> And here it is! My #1 album. This Disney movie we all know about since our childhood is truly one of our favorite fairytales, and for that we are thankful that they released a modernized version. The songs in the movie are indeed a beauty, especially Dan Stevens' "Evermore", who played the role of the beast. Celine Dion was also featured as she sang "How Does A Moment Last Forever." A remake of the song "Beauty and the Beast" was also made by John Legend and Ariana Grande. </p>
